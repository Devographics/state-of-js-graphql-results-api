            <span class="first-letter">A</span>s crappy as 2020 was, JavaScript as a whole still managed to somehow move forward. As the language itself keeps improving
            thanks to new features like Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing, TypeScript's widespread adoption is taking things to a whole other level by popularizing static typing. 

            And on the framework side, just when we thought things were settling down, Svelte comes in and shakes everything up with a fresh take on the front-end. And even build tools are showing signs of new activity after years of webpack dominance. 

            But the difference this time is that the ‚Äúold‚Äù guard ‚Äìrelatively speaking‚Äì is not going anywhere. Svelte and Snowpack are great, but so are React and webpack. And sure, they too will eventually fall prey to the Great JavaScript Churn, but not for many, many years. 

            So let's enjoy what we have here: a great ecosystem that just keeps getting even better!

            ### Join Our Launch Livestream!

            We'll be doing a [special launch livestream](https://stateofjs.com/2020stream/) in collaboration with the folks at the CodeItLive Twitch channel. Join us along with guests such as Sarah Drasner, Josh W. Comeau, and Trent C. Dodds to discuss this past year's JavaScript trends!
            
            ### Download Our Data

            You can [download the raw JSON data for this survey](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-js). Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations!

            ### State of CSS

            If you haven't seen it already, we strongly recommend checking out the [State of CSS 2020 Trend Report](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/report/) to get up to date on the past year's three main CSS trends.

          ## Support the survey and look good in the process!

          We've updated last year's very popular üëï State of JavaScript T-shirt üëï for 
          the 2020 JavaScript landscape!

          The shirt features a ‚Äùperiodic table of JavaScript‚Äù that lists the most popular 
          libraries grouped by category, along with their GitHub stars counts (in thousands).

          This shirt is a great way to familiarize yourself with the JavaScript ecosystem, 
          and maybe even strike up a conversation with other like-minded 
          JavaScript developers!

          This year's survey reached **23,765** people in **137** countries. For the first time this year,
          we were able to translate the survey questions in multiple languages thanks to an awesome team of volunteers.

    - key: sections.features.description
      t: |
          While most respondents were aware of the majority of JavaScript features 
          mentioned in the survey, many still have yet to actually use most of them. 

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          The typical new JavaScript library shows high satisfaction but low usage, which can sometimes make
          selecting the right technology for your needs a bit tricky. This is where looking at
          the data can really help point you in the right direction. 

    - key: sections.javascript_flavors.description
      t: |
          The trend of ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of JavaScript that compile down to standard code started all these
          years ago with CoffeeScript, but it's now clear that TypeScript is the uncontested leader in
          that category. 

    - key: sections.front_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          As usual React and Vue lead the pack, but Svelte is quickly establishing itself as a very 
          serious contender for the front-end crown. 

    - key: sections.datalayer.description
      t: |
          While the datalayer space is still in constant movement, one thing seems clear: GraphQL and
          its related technologies are here to stay. 

    - key: sections.back_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          The back-end space is still very fragmented, but Express stands out as the one dominant
          tool, while Next.js maintains its high satisfaction ratio. 

    - key: sections.testing.description
      t: |
          The testing ecosystem keeps getting richer, with new entrants Testing Library and Playwright both
          scoring high marks on the satisfaction index. 

    - key: sections.build_tools.description
      t: |
          Just when it seemed like webpack's dominance had settled the debate, the build tools scene
          has again exploded with new entrants like Snowpack and esbuild, leading us to give it a full 
          section for the first time since 2017. 

    - key: sections.mobile_desktop.description
      t: |
          JavaScript is not just for the browser, and while Electron and React Native are the two 
          best-known names in this category, other solutions like Expo and Capacitor are also starting 
          to make waves. 

    - key: sections.other_tools.description
      t: |
          The diversity and quantity of libraries, utilities, and other tools highlights how vast the JavaScript
          ecosystem has become, and for the first time this year we're also tracking JavaScript runtimes 
          such as Deno and Hermes. 

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          Many great resources are listed here, and we're sure that you'll find at least a few new 
          blogs or podcasts to follow!

    - key: sections.opinions.description
      t: |
          While things are generally looking good in JavaScript land, there does seem to be a bit of a
          come-down from the positivity high-point of 2018. Will the trend persist? Tune in next year to find out!

            Since ancient times, philosophers have pondered the Paradox of JavaScript: on one hand, you can't wait for exciting new language features and libraries that promise to make your developer experience so much better. 

            But at the same time, you crave stability and simplicity so you can finally get things done without having to spend half your time browsing through convoluted GitHub issues threads and outdated Stack Overflow questions. 

            So which is it? Do we want the new shiny, or the old reliable? More than ever, 2020 shows that we won't settle for anything less than *both*. The good news is that the JavaScript community has risen up to the challenge, which promises an exciting 2021!

            P.S. if you're still hungry for more JavaScript stats we recommend checking out the yearly [Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2020/en/) rankings from [Best Of JS](https://bestofjs.org/).

            2020 because they either helped me stay on top of the latest in JavaScript 
            or helped me learn something new.
