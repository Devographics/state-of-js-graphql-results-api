          ## Support the survey and look good in the process!

          We've updated last year's very popular üëï State of JavaScript T-shirt üëï for 
          the 2020 JavaScript landscape!

          The shirt features a ‚Äùperiodic table of JavaScript‚Äù that lists the most popular 
          libraries grouped by category, along with their GitHub stars counts (in thousands).

          This shirt is a great way to familiarize yourself with the JavaScript ecosystem, 
          and maybe even strike up a conversation with other like-minded 
          JavaScript developers!

          This year's survey reached **11,492** people in **102** countries. For the first time this year,
          we were able to translate the survey questions in multiple languages thanks to an awesome team of volunteers.

    - key: sections.features.description
      t: |
          While most respondents were aware of the majority of JavaScript features 
          mentioned in the survey, many still have yet to actually use most of them. 

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          The typical new JavaScript library shows high satisfaction but low usage, which can sometimes make
          selecting the right technology for your needs a bit tricky. This is where looking at
          the data can really help point you in the right direction. 

    - key: sections.javascript_flavors.description
      t: |
          The trend of ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of JavaScript that compile down to standard code started all these
          years ago with CoffeeScript, but it's now clear that TypeScript is the uncontested leader in
          that category. 

    - key: sections.front_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          As usual React and Vue lead the pack, but Svelte is quickly establishing itself as a very 
          serious contender for the front-end crown. 

    - key: sections.datalayer.description
      t: |
          While the datalayer space is still in constant movement, one thing seems clear: GraphQL and
          its related technologies are here to stay. 

    - key: sections.back_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          The back-end space is still very fragmented, but Express stands out as the one dominant
          tool, while Next.js maintains its high satisfaction ratio. 

    - key: sections.testing.description
      t: |
          The testing ecosystem keeps getting richer, with new entrants Testing Library and Playwright both
          scoring high marks on the satisfaction index. 

    - key: sections.build_tools.description
      t: |
          Just when it seemed like Webpack's dominance had settled the debate, the build tools scene
          has again exploded with new entrants like Snowpack and ESBuild, leading us to give it a full 
          section for the first time since 2017. 

    - key: sections.mobile_desktop.description
      t: |
          JavaScript is not just for the browser, and while Electron and React Native are the two 
          best-known names in this category, other solutions like Expo and Capacitor are also starting 
          to make waves. 

    - key: sections.other_tools.description
      t: |
          The diversity and quantity of libraries, utilities, and other tools highlights how vast the JavaScript
          ecosystem has become, and for the first time this year we're also tracking JavaScript runtimes 
          such as Deno and Hermes. 

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          Many great resources are listed here, and we're sure that you'll find at least a few new 
          blogs or podcasts to follow!

    - key: sections.opinions.description
      t: |
          While things are generally looking good in JavaScript land, there does seem to be a bit of a
          come-down from the positivity high-point of 2018. Will the trend persist? Tune in next year to find out!
