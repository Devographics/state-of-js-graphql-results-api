          This second edition of the State of CSS survey reached 11,307 people in 135 different countries.
          This obviously only represents a tiny part of the overall CSS developer community, but for a second edition
          we think it's pretty encouraging.

          And it's fair to assume our survey audience leans a bit towards early adopters and the more cutting-edge part
          of the community, since they are the ones most likely to hear about a survey in the first place.
          But we like to think this also means our data is a good preview of where the mainstream side of the ecosystem
          will be a few years from now.

          It's also worth mentioning that since a sizeable share of survey respondents learned about it through having
          previously filled out the [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com) survey, our data may also lean toward the
          “[back of the front-end](http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/how-to-think-like-a-front-end-developer-with-brad-frost/)”,
          in other words the more JavaScript-oriented part of the front-end world.

          All that being said, we still think there's a lot of very valuable insights in here, and we're very excited
          to finally be able to share them all with you!

    - key: sections.features.introduction
      t: |
          The story of CSS over the past couple years is one of tremendous flexibility and adaptability.
          CSS may not be perfect, but it's still managed to negotiate a smooth transition to a multitude of new devices,
          contexts, interaction modes, and accessibility requirements.

          With features like Grid, we finally have the tools needed to specify complex layouts without requiring hacks
          and workarounds; while blend modes, masks, and shapes (among others) let us implement designs that are richer
          and more creative than ever.

    - key: sections.layout.introduction
      t: |
          Layout tools are one of the areas that have seen the most changes in recent years.
          First Flexbox came onto the scene, and then CSS Grid emerged as the most polyvalent and expressive way
          of handling CSS layouts.

          It may take a little longer to master, which explains why a lot of users haven't actually used it,
          but it's certainly worth the effort!

    - key: sections.shapes_graphics.introduction
      t: |
          For the longest time, creating advanced graphic effects on the web has either required
          a lot of upfront work in graphics editor apps, or else just plain not been possible.

          But now, with wider support for masking, blend modes, filters, and more, effects that previously
          seemed impossible are just a couple lines of code away. Best of all: because they're now achievable
          through pure CSS, you don't have to give up on accessibility and adaptability anymore.

    - key: sections.interactions.introduction
      t: |
          JavaScript is a handy instrument, but writing hundreds of lines of code just to emulate something
          that should be handled by the browser can sometimes feel like trying to swat flies with a sledgehammer.

          Thanfully CSS is catching up, and properties like CSS Scroll Snap give you more control over
          the browser's behavior, without having to write a single line of JavaScript.

    - key: sections.typography.introduction
      t: |
          Typography is probably the most important building block of the web, and it's great to see CSS
          is still improving its already-good support for typograhical features.

          Variable fonts are the hot new thing here, and while we're still waiting for true responsive type,
          the constant progress on this front is definitely worth keeping an eye on.

    - key: sections.animations_transforms.introduction
      t: |
          Almost all our respondents have used animations, transitions, and transforms. Which should come at no surprise,
          as just ten minutes browsing any modern website will show you that the era of static, motionless pages
          is well and truly over.

          From simple hover effects to more complex typographical or graphical animations,
          CSS can probably handle whatever you can throw at it!

    - key: sections.other_features.introduction
      t: |
          At the end of the day, the bulk of CSS is made up not of sexy, fancy features like Grid or animations;
          but of small, often niche properties that may at first seem useless, but then end up one day saving
          you dozens of hours of work.

          CSS variables and support queries fit in that category: they'll take a little while to grow on you,
          but once you grasp their full potential you'll wonder how you ever managed without them.

    - key: sections.units_selectors.introduction
      t: |
          One of the reasons CSS is so tough to master is that even apparently small decisions can sometimes
          have big consequences. Should you size your fonts in ems or pixels? Which selector should you use?
          Is there a way to avoid having to use JavaScript to accomplish what you want?

          Having a good grasp of units and selectors makes all these decisions, if not simple, at least a little easier.

    - key: sections.pre_post_processors.introduction
      t: |
          Pre-processors like Sass and Less were the vanguard of “CSS 2.0”. At a time where the language itself
          could seem pretty stagnant, they introduced new features like variables and nesting by introducing
          a compile step to the mix.

          More than a decade later, CSS itself is catching up but the pre-processors are holding strong,
          with Sass being a mainstay in any front-end stack (although CSS-in-JS is looking to change that –
          but more on this later).

          And on the “post-processor” side, PostCSS has managed to carve out a niche of its own by being
          a complementary tool that makes your CSS workflow even better.

    - key: sections.css_frameworks.introduction
      t: |
          For years the debate has raged on: should you use UI toolkits like Bootstrap, or is that “cheating”?
          Will all websites end up looking the same? And will designers end up being useless?

          In 2019, it's safe to say the debate has been settled, and the frameworks have won.
          Bootstrap has kept up with the times and generated a huge ecosystem of various themes and plugins,
          while Google's Material Design has helped popularized its own specific aesthetic.

          And while the utility-class-focused approach of new frameworks like Tailwind CSS make you question everything
          you know about writing “proper” semantic CSS, its 81% satisfaction ratio means that it might be time
          to reconsider our old preconceived notions…

    - key: sections.css_methodologies.introduction
      t: |
          CSS stands out among programming languages (if it even is one… but that's a whole other debate!)
          as one of the few that has given birth to methodologies that aim to codify the “right” way to write it.

          While BEM is ahead of the pack here, Atomic CSS is also starting to gain ground with its completely
          new utility-class-driven philosophy.

          In the end, we might never find the one true way to write CSS, but that's not going to stop us from looking!

    - key: sections.css_in_js.introduction
      t: |
          CSS-in-JS has been one of the biggest developments of the past few years in the CSS world.
          Just like preprocessors bypassed CSS to introduce their own set of new features over a decade ago,
          CSS-in-JS libraries piggyback on JavaScript's power to make their own path without waiting for CSS to catch up.

          But while some libraries like Styled Components and Emotion have established themselves as solid options,
          the overall ecosystem is still very fragmented and in constant movement. So it remains
          to be seen what place CSS-in-JS will occupy in the overall ecosystem in the long run.

          One thing is sure though: more competition is always good, and if CSS can steal some of its JavaScript cousin's
          freshest ideas then we'll all be better off for it!

    - key: sections.opinions.introduction
      t: |
          Sometimes the best way to take the pulse of a community is to just go ahead and ask.
          From your opinion about CSS's rate of change, to more thorny questions like whether CSS
          should be considered a programming language, you finally had a chance to tell us exactly what's on your mind!

          For each of the following statements, we asked you how much you agreed on a 5-point scale.
