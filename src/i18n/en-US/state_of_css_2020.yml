          The shirt features the State of CSS logo along with snippets of the actual CSS code used to create each shape. Who knows, you might learn a thing or two!

          We use a high-quality, super-soft tri-blend shirt with a slim fit. 
          This shirt sizes small, so if you prefer a looser fit we recommend ordering one size up from what you usually wear (I'm wearing an M in the photos).

          CSS has seen a surge of new features in recent years, so as you'd expect adoption is
          lagging a bit behind as the community takes its time to absorb new properties.

          The CSS ecosystem is going through a renewal of sorts, as older mainstays like Bootstrap 
          now have to accomodate newer entrants like Tailwind CSS. To say nothing of the whole CSS-in-JS
          movement which, while it has yet to cross over to the CSS mainstream, is nonetheless quite dynamic.

          No big surprises here, but it's worth highlighting the appearance of development-focused browsers
          like Polypane and Sizzy, which go a step further than traditional devtools.

          One of CSS's core strengths is its ability to adapt to different environment, yet for a variety
          of reasons media like print and email remain unexplored by a majority of CSS developers. Might they
          turn out to be the next frontier of CSS‚Ä¶?

          The ‚Äúother answers‚Äù results in this section highlight the richness and diversity of the CSS community,
          and feature many outstanding blogs and podcasts which we are looking forward to officially adding
          to the survey next year!

          These opinions paint a picture of a language getting more mature, but also more complex. And perhaps
          ‚Äìat least while we struggle to keep up with the pace of change‚Äì a little less enjoyable?
