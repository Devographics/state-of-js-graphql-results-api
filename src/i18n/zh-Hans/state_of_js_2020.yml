            <span class="first-letter">尽</span>管2020年很糟糕，但 JavaScript 整体上仍然在设法向前发展。得益于像可选链(Optional Chaining)和空值合并运算符(Nullish Coalescing)这样的新特性，语言本身在不断改进，而 TypeScript 的广泛使用将静态类型化普及到了一个新的高度。 

            在框架方面，就在我们以为一切都已经稳定下来的时候，Svelte 的出现以一种全新的方式撼动了前端的一切。甚至连构建工具在经历了多年的 webpack 统治之后，也出现了新的活动迹象。 

            但这次不同的是，"老牌"后卫-相对而言-不会消失。Svelte 和 Snowpack 很优秀，但 React 和 webpack 也同样如此。当然，它们最终也会成为JavaScript变革的牺牲品，但至少很多很多年内不会。 

            所以，让我们享受我们所拥有的:一个不断变得更好的伟大的生态系统! 

            ### 加入我们的发布直播！

            我们将与 CodeItLive Twitch 频道的人合作，做一个[特别发布直播]（https://stateofjs.com/2020stream/）。加入我们，与Sarah Drasner 、 Josh W. Comeau 和 Trent C. Dodds 等嘉宾一起讨论过去一年的 JavaScript 趋势。
            
            ### 下载我们的数据

          This year's survey reached **23,765** people in **137** countries. For the first time this year,
          we were able to translate the survey questions in multiple languages thanks to an awesome team of volunteers.

    - key: sections.features.description
      t: |
          While most respondents were aware of the majority of JavaScript features 
          mentioned in the survey, many still have yet to actually use most of them. 

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          The typical new JavaScript library shows high satisfaction but low usage, which can sometimes make
          selecting the right technology for your needs a bit tricky. This is where looking at
          the data can really help point you in the right direction. 

    - key: sections.javascript_flavors.description
      t: |
          The trend of “flavors” of JavaScript that compile down to standard code started all these
          years ago with CoffeeScript, but it's now clear that TypeScript is the uncontested leader in
          that category. 

    - key: sections.front_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          As usual React and Vue lead the pack, but Svelte is quickly establishing itself as a very 
          serious contender for the front-end crown. 

    - key: sections.datalayer.description
      t: |
          While the datalayer space is still in constant movement, one thing seems clear: GraphQL and
          its related technologies are here to stay. 

    - key: sections.back_end_frameworks.description
      t: |
          The back-end space is still very fragmented, but Express stands out as the one dominant
          tool, while Next.js maintains its high satisfaction ratio. 

    - key: sections.testing.description
      t: |
          The testing ecosystem keeps getting richer, with new entrants Testing Library and Playwright both
          scoring high marks on the satisfaction index. 

    - key: sections.build_tools.description
      t: |
          Just when it seemed like webpack's dominance had settled the debate, the build tools scene
          has again exploded with new entrants like Snowpack and esbuild, leading us to give it a full 
          section for the first time since 2017. 

    - key: sections.mobile_desktop.description
      t: |
          JavaScript is not just for the browser, and while Electron and React Native are the two 
          best-known names in this category, other solutions like Expo and Capacitor are also starting 
          to make waves. 

    - key: sections.other_tools.description
      t: |
          The diversity and quantity of libraries, utilities, and other tools highlights how vast the JavaScript
          ecosystem has become, and for the first time this year we're also tracking JavaScript runtimes 
          such as Deno and Hermes. 

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          Many great resources are listed here, and we're sure that you'll find at least a few new 
          blogs or podcasts to follow!

    - key: sections.opinions.description
      t: |
          While things are generally looking good in JavaScript land, there does seem to be a bit of a
          come-down from the positivity high-point of 2018. Will the trend persist? Tune in next year to find out!

            Since ancient times, philosophers have pondered the Paradox of JavaScript: on one hand, you can't wait for exciting new language features and libraries that promise to make your developer experience so much better. 

            But at the same time, you crave stability and simplicity so you can finally get things done without having to spend half your time browsing through convoluted GitHub issues threads and outdated Stack Overflow questions. 

            So which is it? Do we want the new shiny, or the old reliable? More than ever, 2020 shows that we won't settle for anything less than *both*. The good news is that the JavaScript community has risen up to the challenge, which promises an exciting 2021!

            P.S. if you're still hungry for more JavaScript stats we recommend checking out the yearly [Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2020/en/) rankings from [Best Of JS](https://bestofjs.org/).

            we build are usable by everyone, not just sighted keyboard-and-mouse users.

            Remix is a different approach to React frameworks with an emphasis on progressive 
            enhancement. It embraces the web platform in a way that no existing frameworks do 
            and I'm excited by its potential.

            Insomnia is an app that allows you to design, test, and deploy API 
            Workflows with a clean, simplified UX- it has both REST and GraphQL support, 
            though clearly the puns are better if you're using REST.

            Josh Comeau has been an inspiration to me, and I can say the JS community in general. 
            He writes very thoughtful articles on his blog, and they are some of the best I read in 
            2020 because they either helped me stay on top of the latest in JavaScript 
            or helped me learn something new.

            Volta helps manage your entire JavaScript toolchain – think nvm, but it also helps 
            you and your team stay on the same versions of Node, npm, CLI tools, etc. 
            I love it because it's so darn nice to use, and is pioneering the use of 
            Rust to build speedy tools for JS.
