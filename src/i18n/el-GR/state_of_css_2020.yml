            <span class="first-letter">Ξ</span>εχάστε οτι ξέρατε για την CSS. Ή τουλάχιστον, να είστε έτοιμοι να επανεξετάσετε πολλά από αυτά. Αν όπως εγώ γράφετε CSS για πάνω από μια δεκαετία, CSS το 2020 δεν μοιάζει τίποτα με αυτό που είχατε συνηθίσει να.

            Αντί για breakpoints, μπορούμε τώρα να αξιοποιήσουμε την CSS Grid για να κάνουμε δυναμικές, ανταποκρινόμενες διατάξεις που προσαρμόζονται σε οποιοδήποτε μέγεθος προβολής με λιγότερες γραμμές κώδικα. Αντί να βασίζεται σε global stylesheets, CSS-in-JS μας επιτρέπει να υπολογίσουμε το στυλ μας με τα components για την κατασκευή θεματικών συστήματων σχεδιασμού.

            Και πάνω απ'όλα, η CSS του Tailwind έχει εμφανιστεί στη σκηνή και μέσω της utility-first CSS, μας ανάγκασε να επανεξετάσουμε το παραδοσιακό τρόπο των σημασιολογικών ονομάτων κλάσης.

            Είτε αυτή η αλλαγή σας κάνει να θέλετε να γράψετε ένα hyped-up blog post ή ένα angry Twitter rant, είμαστε εδώ για να παρουσιάσουμε τα δεδομένα, να αναδείξουμε τις τάσεις, και ελπίζω να σας καθοδηγήσουμε μέσα από μια άλλη περιπετειώδη χρονιά της CSS!

          Μια γρήγορη ανακοίνωση πριν από τα αποτελέσματα της έρευνας. Καθιέρωση της δικής μας 🎈🎉👕 State of CSS T-shirt 👕🎉🎈!

          Αυτό που κάνει αυτό το πουκάμισο πραγματικά ξεχωριστό είναι ότι είναι το μόνο κομμάτι ρουχισμού που σας διδάσκει πρακτικές τεχνικές CSS.

          Έτσι, είτε πρόκειται για ένα συνέδριο, μια συνέντευξη εργασίας, ή απλά εργασία, αυτό το πουκάμισο θα αναδείξει την  δεξιοτεχνία της CSS όπως κανένα άλλο ένδυμα μπορεί!

          Το πουκάμισο περιλαμβάνει το λογότυπο State of CSS μαζί με αποσπάσματα του πραγματικού κώδικα CSS που χρησιμοποιείται για τη δημιουργία κάθε σχήματος. Ποιος ξέρει, μπορεί να μάθετε ένα ή δύο πράγματα!

          Χρησιμοποιούμε ένα υψηλής ποιότητας, σούπερ μαλακό tri-blend πουκάμισο με λεπτή εφαρμογή.
Αυτό το πουκάμισο έχει μικρά μεγέθη, οπότε αν προτιμάτε μια πιο χαλαρή εφαρμογή συνιστούμε να παραγγείλετε ένα μέγεθος από αυτό που συνήθως φοράτε (φοράω ένα M στις φωτογραφίες).

          This year's survey reached **11,492** people in **102** countries. For the first time this year,
          we were able to translate the survey questions in multiple languages thanks to an awesome team of volunteers.

    - key: sections.features.description
      t: |
          CSS has seen a surge of new features in recent years, so as you'd expect adoption is
          lagging a bit behind as the community takes its time to absorb new properties.

          We're willing to bet you'll find a few things you didn't know about in this section!

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          The CSS ecosystem is going through a renewal of sorts, as older mainstays like Bootstrap 
          now have to accomodate newer entrants like Tailwind CSS. To say nothing of the whole CSS-in-JS
          movement which, while it has yet to cross over to the CSS mainstream, is nonetheless quite dynamic. 

    - key: sections.other_tools.description
      t: |
          No big surprises here, but it's worth highlighting the appearance of development-focused browsers
          like Polypane and Sizzy, which go a step further than traditional devtools.

    - key: sections.environments.description
      t: |
          One of CSS's core strengths is its ability to adapt to different environment, yet for a variety
          of reasons media like print and email remain unexplored by a majority of CSS developers. Might they
          turn out to be the next frontier of CSS…?

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          The “other answers” results in this section highlight the richness and diversity of the CSS community,
          and feature many outstanding blogs and podcasts which we are looking forward to officially adding
          to the survey next year!

    - key: sections.opinions.description
      t: |
          These opinions paint a picture of a language getting more mature, but also more complex. And perhaps
          –at least while we struggle to keep up with the pace of change– a little less enjoyable?

            If a JavaScript developer writes a line of CSS code, are they now a CSS developer?
            
            This programming *kōan* illustrates a clear trend in the web development world: as more and more CSS developers are tasked with learning JavaScript, so are JavaScript developers starting to realize there might be more to this whole CSS thing than just `font-weight: bold;`. 

            So asking about “the State of CSS” is inherently a tricky proposition: depending on who you ask you might get completely different answers! And how do you know which one's right?

            Here's another kōan for you: the right answer is that there *is* no right answer. Each of the many tools, methodologies, frameworks, and libraries featured here has its place in the vast front-end ecosystem. 

            Building a complex React app? Styled Components is a great option. Designing a static landing page? You can't go wrong with Sass! And even though Bootstrap has lost some of its original hype factor, you can't beat it when it comes to sheer number of themes and plugins.

            So while we keep an eye on the shiny new toys popping up on GitHub every week, let's not forget the tools, techniques, and most of all people who have carried the CSS torch up to now. We'll need everybody if we're to keep CSS moving forward into 2021 and beyond!
